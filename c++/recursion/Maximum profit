You are given an array and indices of the array represent minutes and data values represent prices of a stock as they were yesterday . You need to figure out and return the maximum profit you can make by buying and selling of the stock. You can buy and sell the stock only once.
Constraints :
1 <= N <= 10^6
Input Format :
Line 1 : An integer N i.e. size of the array
Line 2 : N integers which are elements of the array, separated by spaces
Output Format :
Single integer i.e. Maximum Profit
Sample Input :
 4 
 2 100 150 120
Sample Output :
148
Sample Output Explanation :
Maximum profit can be achieved by buying stock at minute 0 when its price is Rs. 2 and selling it at minute 2 when its price is Rs 150. Hence profit is Rs. (150 - 2) = Rs. 148


#include<climits>
int maxProfit(int *arr,int l)
{
int min=arr[0],maxprofit=INT_MIN,profit=0;
    
    for(int i=0;i<l;i++)
    {
        if(arr[i]<min)
        {
            min=arr[i];
        }
        //you can only buy stocks in path and sell them in future
        //so we're maintiaining minimum of past and finding maximum of future
        
        profit=arr[i]-min;
        if(profit>maxprofit)
        {
            maxprofit=profit;
        }     
        
    }
    return maxprofit;
    
    
}
